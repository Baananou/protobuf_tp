# products.json file size is 115 bytes

# productsbinary file size is 52 bytes

#

# Conclusion

the protobuf format is more compact and efficient than JSON for representing structured data. 

# More Details:

- Protobuf is a binary format, while JSON is a text format. The binary format allows for more compact and faster data representation and processing.

- Protobuf is designed to be an efficient data exchange format, optimized for fast serialization and deserialization of structured data. It uses specific encoding techniques to reduce data size, such as varint encoding for integers and delta encoding for floating-point numbers.

- JSON is designed to be a human-readable format, easy to understand and manipulate. It includes formatting characters (spaces, line breaks, etc.) to make the document structure clearer. These formatting characters increase the size of the JSON file.
